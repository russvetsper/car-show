       <p>In 2014 got a job as a parking enforcment but after spending few summeres in a car with no A/C i ran for me dear life.</p>
       <p>At my parking enforcment job i met Austin and Rouz and started talkin about how we want to get into tech field.</p>
       <p>Rouz was looking into Epicodus but since it was to far away he couldnt go, then in a week he got an email saying that
